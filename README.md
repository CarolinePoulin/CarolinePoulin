I write regular blog posts, most of which you will find on my personal website [waylonwalker.com](https://waylonwalker.com) and [dev.to/waylonwalker](https://dev.to/waylonwalker).

I write about things I am familiar with, things that trip up folks that I mentor, and things that I am learning.  Day to day I make things with **data** using **python** and **javascript**.
